# Edit New Best!

Move the Geometry Dash "NEW BEST!" banner wherever you like, resize it, or hide it completely.

## Highlights
- Pick a preset anchor (top-left, top-middle, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-middle, bottom-right) or keep the original position
- Enter exact X/Y coordinates for a fully custom layout
- Scale the popup from subtle reminders to screen-filling flashes
- Shorten or extend how long the banner stays on screen
- Hide the popup entirely when you want distraction-free attempts

## Using the Mod
1. Install and enable the mod through the Geode loader.
2. Play a level and hit a new personal best once so the banner appears.
3. **To enter settings:** Enter the **Geode Main Menu** and navigate to **Edit New Best!** mod **->** click the **Gear Icon**.
4. Adjust the sliders and toggles, then play again. The popup uses your new settings the next time it shows up.

## Settings Reference
- **Popup Position**: Choose `Default`, `Top Left`, `Top Middle`, `Top Right`, `Bottom Left`, `Bottom Middle`, `Bottom Right`, or `Custom`.
- **Custom X Position / Custom Y Position**: Available when the position is set to `Custom`. Coordinates are screen pixels measured from the bottom-left corner.
- **Hide Popup**: Toggle to disable the banner.
- **Popup Scale**: Slider from 0.1x to 2.0x for shrinking or enlarging the popup.
- **Popup Duration**: Slider that controls how many seconds the banner stays before shrinking away.

## Tips
- If you move the popup off-screen, switch **Popup Position** back to `Default` to reset it.
- Short durations keep the feedback without interrupting gameplay flow.
- Combining a smaller scale with a corner anchor makes room for high-visibility layouts.

Dial in the look that matches your practice routine and celebrate new bests on your own terms!
